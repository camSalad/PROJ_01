- Developed on Linux mint
- use the make file and include a main.cpp in the directory
- Not a bug, but the print stream operator hangs b/c of how I implemented it.
- approached the problem by doing the two function that need to be in O(1), and the constructors first. 
  I then went after the operators and then the output function which seemed to be my biggest struggle. 
  I'm not sure that I did it in the most efficient way it seems like its running in O(n^3) time.
